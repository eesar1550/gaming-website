## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Markup structure
- **CSS3** – Custom animations, gradients, responsiveness
- **JavaScript** – For interactive elements like the "Next" button
- **Boxicons** – Social media icons
- **Video Elements** – Embedded `.mp4` videos

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- The homepage plays a fullscreen video loop with overlayed hero text.
- Clicking the `NEXT` button (styled as a circular element) triggers functionality in `app.js`, potentially sliding to the next section or triggering animations.
- Scroll animations are tied to view timeline APIs (CSS-based), enhancing section reveals.
